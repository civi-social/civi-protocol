Concepts

# Individuals
Individuals must be able to be the main focus

# Offices (owned by the people)

Individuals can join offices based on some verification system.

Offices maybe can be their own federated servers?

Important: office servers should be owned by the people.

Elected official is merely a role of an individual  

# Interaction with real world built in

Verification of users addresses/voter registration should be built in.

should most "content" on the protocol be generated from verified sources like legislation sites?

# Polling

Accept that certain types of polling, especially high stakes ones, are still best done in real analog environments. its why NBA draft still used ping pong balls  

Should we do things like allow/force physical printing? And/or create a recount feature?

Is polling based on decentralized crypto?

whatever polling method we go with, we should assign trustworthiness score and based the ux, guaruntees, and features around that score.

Open Questions: where does the users identity exist? on device? if they lose their device, what happens?
