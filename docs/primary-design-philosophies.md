# Entities

## Individuals as the primary Entity
- Individuals must be able to be the main focus
- How does individual security work?
  - Lies on device?
  - If they lose their device or someone hacks their device, what happens?
  - What if they need to transfer devices?

Some solutions I'm thinking atm are inspired by either the Signal Protocol or Scuttlebutt for this

## Offices (owned by the people)

 - Offices maybe can be their own federated servers?
 - The servers should be easy for the people to be able to own it.
 - The server should be verifiable that it wasn't tampered with.
 - Individuals can join offices based on some verification system.

Important: office servers should be owned by the people.

Elected official is merely a role of an individual  

## Polling

- Accept that certain types of polling, especially high stakes ones, are still best done in real analog environments. its why NBA draft still uses ping pong balls. Current best tech security practices still encourage paper ballots at the most secure method.
- Should we have some paper trail? Should we do things like allow/force physical printing? And/or create a recount feature?
- Is polling based on decentralized crypto?
- Whatever polling method we go with, we should assign trustworthiness score and based the ux, guaruntees, and features around that score.
- Another question around polling, how can data stay encrypted when submitted, and only in tallying is it unecrypted?

# Some Principles To Explore

## Not Everything Has To Be Digital

Whether its verification/ polling, or other things, not everything in this protocol needs to be digital. Trust has to be assigned somewhere, and super complicated digital solutions won't necessarily gain everyone's trust.

## Should "content" be automated?

Should most "content" on the protocol be generated from verified sources like legislation sites?
